# BankingSystem
This project is an adaptation from the website cppforschool.com (http://www.cppforschool.com/project/banking-system-project.html)
Refer to the youtube video in the link for a main demonstration of the banking system.

There have been some additions to the functionality:
* Error handling for incorrect or false input.
* Users have the ability to load a pre-existing bank through a save file from the command line.
* Incorrectly formated files will be rejected. See example.txt for the layout of the savefile.
* Users can save the status of the bank into a seperate file.

## Running this file.
To run the command make, the system used requires g++.

To run the program the following can be put into the command line:

./bank or ./bank savefile.txt
